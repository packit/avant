# Celery worker which runs tasks (packit) from the web service

# For now we always build FROM packit-worker:latest which is not what we want long term
# We want either:
# - build hardly from packit-worker:latest or packit-worker:stable based on our branch
# - first build packit-worker:latest, but install deps from their main/stable branches based on our branch
#   and then build hardly FROM it
# - build hardly FROM packit/base and install all deps from their main/stable branches based on our branch
FROM quay.io/packit/packit-worker:dev

# the base image sets WORKDIR to /src
